The heroes are Tlatoani - warriors with ability to use spokenwords to change reality by changing themselves, or reality itselves.
Tlatoani get their strengthes from PowerSources to defeat their enemies. Each tlatoani on simple level can use readied variants of
FortWords, and by vecoming Huei Tlatoani they can compose theirs Fortwords themselves.
The main charackteristics of tlatoani are somewhat aligned with sources, so:
1)Vitality - Amount of shit to carry
2)Power - Amount of damage to deal
3)Evasion - Ability to ignore shit
4)Rate - Ability to inflict damage more directly and in bigger amounts.

Sources:
1)FIRE - Aggressive, Power-like
2)WATER - Passive, Evasion-like
3)EARTH - Passive, Vitality-like
4)AIR - Aggresive, Rate-like

The developement of a Tlatoani can change your alignments to different elements, but inner alignment is also can be changed
by methods of inner chaos controlling.
Each class can use all of sources, but in different ways. For example, for Pregxist different sources are visioned as gods, for
Elementalist - as nature spirits. Tlatoani have variants to use the sources for good.
To make ya usage of sources better, you need to hear Essence of source. But it's very difficult to hear real Essence, so
Tlatoani are wandering across world and visit places of Power, Where some Source Node can be found, where Carefu listener can found something
new about the Sources, to make himself better. This race is eternal.

(What about synthesised music, cries, graphics and all other? it will be fun!)

Each class have its Methods to use Sources. To use Wordspeaker ability, tlatoani need to specify Sourcename, Method, Targeting mode, and target.
The combination of first three can be used as a black box, and so start every tlatoani, who have no idea about the Source.
