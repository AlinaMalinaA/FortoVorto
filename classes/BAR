Barbaro class conception.

Barbaro is a warrior class. He uses VOICE to become more powerfull himself, or to make his enemies run away.
His voice can be targetet at:

1)Enemy : Battlecry
2)Sky : Warrior's pray - makes instant effect, or adds a status to barbaro
3)Enemy, while striking him: Shoutstrike

example synsets:

SANGRO (Blood)
  BC: Loud attack at enemy, that makes his wounds to open wider (increases bleedrate of enemy).
  WP: Blood Bath - Barbaro regains health for every bleeding unit on battlefield. Amount based on bleedrate and count.
  SS: Attack an enemy, making him bleed. Bleedrate is based on the most powerfull strike of Barbaro.

FREQ (Critical)
  BC: Makes his enemies to have a chance to deal less damage with their attacks
  WP: Barbaro prepares the BATTLELEAP - the strike with minimizied rate, but always critical.
  SS: Attacks an enemy, having chance to deal more damage, than usuall

SUFERO (PUNISHMENT)
  WP: Increases damage of Barbaro for next strike everytime he loses helth during the turn
  
VENTO (STORMWIND)
  SS: Attack  multiply enemies across the battlefield with raised rate

BATTLEPRICE 
  SS: Attack with increased damage, paying with blood.

FEAR
  BC: Makes enemies of Barbaro chance to lose their turn or runaway from battlefield

RETRIBUTION
  BC: Deals damage, Based on health, losed by barbaro.

SACRIFICE
  WP: Barbaro makes an open wound on himself and gains extra rage

Easy mode allows Barbaro to make casts like this:

{WORD}TAR to SS
{WORD} to WP
{WORD}ATAR to BC

In hard mode Barbaro is allowed to write INSTINCTS - powerfull modules, describing barbaro's reaction to every action of bicho.

Barbaro Difficulty Conception:
1)Each Cry has it's pitch: high, low, or middle. To be effective, Barbaro must very clever use his shouts, or he has a chance to lose his voice. Example:
MIDDLE -> LOW = GOOD, MIDDLE -> HIGH = GOOD, HIGH -> MIDDLE = GOOD, LOW -> MIDDLE = GOOD
MIDDLE -> MIDDLE = NOT GOOD, LOW -> HIGH = NOT GOOD, HIGH -> LOW = NOT GOOD
LOW -> LOW = BAD, HIGH -> HIGH = BAD

2)Resource for Barbaro's casts is RAGE. The rage must be above 0 to make Barbaro strike smbdy, and also must be belove than (100?) Because if rage overcomes 100, BARBARO becomes unctrollable and strikes his enemies as he wants.
