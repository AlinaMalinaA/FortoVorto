don't know. what about just implement different moduses of using pw for heroes?
ekzemple: BATTLESTRIKE and BATTLECRY for Barbaro.
POTION, SPRAY and GRENADE for SKIENC.
CAST and BOLT for ELM.

Basic Mechanic.
Barbaro is stupid. He just shouts. But, to do so, he needs;
1)Rage
2)Voice.

Barbaro gets rage by hitting enemies and getting hitted, and count of rage is required to do more powerfull cries.
Voice. Every cry going on it's pitch. to make more powerfull cries, the barbaro must not be not stupid: using more than two cries on one height in the same row makes him to lose voice on some time. This sucks, b.t.w.
Losing his own blood is also is frequent tactic of barbaros. see it.

BARBARO:

Basic skill: BATTLESTRIKE - leap torward enemy shouting the battlecry.
Special skill: BATTLECRY - shout the shit into the sky, so the gods can hear it. BATTLECRY can make Barbaro stronger, his enemies weaker, and also damages enemies. Also, The BARBARO can go berserk after shouting BATTLECRY.

+)BLOOD - makes the target body bleed.
+)OVERCHARGE - makes more damage, paying your own health.
+)KRIT-STRIKE - have a chance to deal more damage.

Every cast, that skiencist need is a FORMULA.
use FORMULA base cast to combine shit.
use ACID SPRAY, POTION, or GRENADE to use this formula. The level of skien is how many formulas he can store at the same time.
WORD is a mainESSENSE of formula - some shit, that makes all formula work. But, to do it in most effective way, u must effectively prepare your formula, using additional materials, such as water-regulating and temperature-regulating materials. 
If formula has too many water, it's not strong formula. if formula has too low water, it simply is defacking. if temperature is too low, the formulais malinert. if temperature is too high, the formula can explode in your hands.
so:
1)Make formula
2)use, that you want.
And watch your fucking supplies.
SKIENCIST:
Basic skill: ACID SPRAY - uses his science formula to piss it on enemies.
Special skill: FORMULA - makes a potion out of formula elements and does smt with it.


+)POISON - makes enemy to get more damage every turn
+)STUN - makes enemy chance to forget to strike
+)EXPLOSION - makes the neighbours of target suffer also


Elementist has 4 basic elements to operate on. Every cast in his arsenal has it's own allegiance to this elements. Every enemy has resitances.
So, the main point of elementist, is using of basic Elemental spells or LoRE to get info about enemy's weak spots, and then adjust your casts to make it fucking awesome.
FOR EXAMPLE: basically, FEURER FREI is a FFFF cast, meaning, it is based on only fire. but, if we encounter FIRE GIANT, that can heal itself from fire, You must use, for example, COLDARO help cast to transform your FEURER FREI cast into COLD GRIP OF PUNISHMENT cast, so you could use cold version of your cast.
